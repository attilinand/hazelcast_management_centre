==== Hazelcast Management Center 3.12 ====

1. New Features

* Introduced the Management Center Configuration (`mc-conf`) tool which
is a command line utility that allows you to update certain parts of the
Management Center configuration by using its built-in commands, including
creating the users externally and resetting security configurations. See
the Management Center Configuration Tool chapter for more information.
* Added support for blue/green deployments. Management Center curates
blacklisted and whitelisted clients that are allowed/not allowed to
connect to the cluster. Hazelcast IMDG members receive the information
about the active lists from the Management Center (during startup and later
on) and apply it for all the current and future clients.
* Added nested group support for Active Directory and LDAP logins so that
the nested groups have the same privileges of their parent group. See the
Authentication Options chapter for more information.
* The Members page now shows which members have CP data structures.
